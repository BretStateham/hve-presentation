# feat(presentations): initialize Marp multi-presentation setup for HVE upskilling

Set up a complete Marp-powered presentation repository for Hypervelocity Engineering upskilling. The repo supports multiple independent slide decks, shared theming, local image references, and Marp CLI server mode for presenting — all configured with npm scripts, VS Code integration, and a well-documented README.

- feat(presentations): added 19-slide Introduction to HVE deck sourced from the HVE Customer FAQ covering the four pillars of HVE, myth busting (what HVE is NOT), and how HVE helps build enterprise solutions — including friction removal, accelerators, governance, team sizing, and measuring success (`presentations/01-introduction/introduction.md`)

- feat(presentations): created landing page index deck listing available presentations with navigation instructions (`presentations/index.md`)

- feat(config): initialized npm project with `@marp-team/marp-cli` as dev dependency and added npm scripts for `start` (server mode), `build` (HTML), `build:pdf` (PDF), and `watch` (auto-rebuild) (`package.json`)

- feat(config): added Marp CLI configuration enabling local file access and shared theme directory (`marp.config.mjs`)

- feat(themes): created HVE-branded custom CSS theme extending Marp's default theme with organizational color variables and typography (`themes/hve.css`)

- feat(vscode): configured VS Code workspace with Marp theme paths and extension recommendation for `marp-team.marp-vscode` (`.vscode/settings.json`, `.vscode/extensions.json`)

- docs(readme): rewrote README with comprehensive usage guide covering presenting, authoring, building, adding new presentations, project structure, and themes (`README.md`)

- chore: added `.gitignore` for Node.js artifacts, build output, watch-mode HTML/PDF artifacts, and OS files

- feat(structure): established directory-per-presentation structure under `presentations/` with shared `images/` and `themes/` directories at root level
