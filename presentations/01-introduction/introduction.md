# Introduction to Hypervelocity Engineering

Accelerating software delivery with engineering excellence

<!-- This is a presenter note. Press P during presentation to see notes. -->

## What is Hypervelocity Engineering?

Hypervelocity Engineering (HVE) is a set of principles and practices designed to **maximize the speed and quality** of software delivery.

It combines:

- 🏗️ **Modern engineering practices**
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development**
- 🔄 **Continuous delivery pipelines**
- 📏 **Measurable outcomes**

---

## Why Does Velocity Matter?

> "The best way to predict the future is to implement it."

- Faster feedback loops → Better products
- Reduced lead time → Happier customers
- Automated toil → More innovation time
- Measurable flow → Continuous improvement

---

## Core Principles

1. **Automate Everything** — If you do it twice, automate it
2. **Shift Left** — Find issues earlier, fix them cheaper
3. **Measure What Matters** — DORA metrics, flow metrics
4. **Continuous Learning** — Blameless retrospectives, knowledge sharing
5. **Small Batches** — Reduce risk, increase throughput

## The DORA Metrics

| Metric | Elite | High | Medium | Low |
|--------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| **Deployment Frequency** | On-demand | Weekly | Monthly | Yearly |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | < 1 hour | < 1 week | < 1 month | > 6 months |
| **Change Failure Rate** | < 5% | < 10% | < 15% | > 30% |
| **Time to Restore** | < 1 hour | < 1 day | < 1 week | > 6 months |

<!-- Note: These benchmarks are from the DORA State of DevOps Report -->
